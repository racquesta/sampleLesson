Oh no! The current inventory interface is not very friendly and does not offer the ability to add new items to the list. Open the speadsheet at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1izJAXW77oYjh2MPspuGUjirxJ2ZViJfztjcMbhi2Dwk/copy and alter the script to do the following.

If the item is not in inventory, alert the user that this is the case, and ask then to check their spelling. (You might even want to eliminate the case-sensitivity.)

In the same alert, allow the user to press YES to add the the item to the inventory list, and NO to cancel.

Collect the response to the alert, and if the user responded with YES, add the item to the list. Then, prompt the user to give a value, and add it to the appropriate place.

BONUS: (Your choice!)

Add a custom menu or sidebar that will run your script.

Handle users not entering a number on the prompt screen for values.

Hints:

Utilize the google apps scripts reference section for additional ideas and help with available methods.
