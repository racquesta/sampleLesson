1. Open the Google Sheets file at the provided link, and run the code to demonstrate the solution to students.  

2. Color the Pixel Art Face using colors of your choosing.  Some hexidecimal color codes are provided should you want to use them.  Otherwise, a simple google search for the color you are looking for or a visit to http://cloford.com/resources/colours/500col.htm will do.  

3. Assign at least two cells character values (strings or ints).  This can be incorporated into your art or be a title given at the bottom.  

Bonus:  Create an additional function that returns the spreadsheet to its original state.  

Hint:  You may want to incorporate javascript conditionals and/or loops to make your code more efficient.
